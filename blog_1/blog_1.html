        Nestled in the vibrant streets of Lower Nob Hill, Haraz Coffee offers a delightful fusion of Arabic tradition and modern convenience. Its accommodating operating hours, stretching until 11:00 PM or even midnight, make it an ideal spot for late-night study sessions or casual gatherings with friends. I decided to go on a Monday night, between 9:00 to 11:00 PM where the atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable.

        Stepping inside, I was impressed with its impeccable cleanliness and a medium noise level that struck a perfect balance for concentration or conversation. The lightning-fast WiFi ensured productivity, and finding a spot to settle in was effortless with the spacious layout and various seating options. Tempted to try a snack, I ordered the baklava, which was priced at $7.00 for a late-night dessert, offering a crunchy, flavorful treat that complements their aromatic coffee blends. Conveniently, there's also a bathroom on-site for a quick refresh. Despite its strengths, Haraz Coffee isn't without its drawbacks. The limited number of power outlets may inconvenience those needing to charge devices, and its location, while convenient, is slightly farther from school, requiring a 25 minute bus ride or a 16 minute walk from Japantown. Additionally, the slightly higher drink prices, averaging $7.85 due to their unique selection, reflect the quality and ambiance of the cafe. Still, I ordered a green tea coffee for $5.50 as caffiene wasn't needed so late at night.

        Overall, I'd rate Haraz Coffee a solid 8 out of 10. With its welcoming atmosphere, delicious treats, and convenient amenities, it's a haven for coffee lovers and students alike, offering a taste of something different in the heart of San Francisco's bustling streets.
