        Tucked away near the Panhandle in San Francisco, Sacred Grounds offers a study haven with a vintage San Francisco vibe. Stepping inside feels like stepping back in time, surrounded by the city's old-school charm. I found that this coffee shop is a very productive study space and a hidden gem overall. One of the best things about Sacred Grounds is their tea. While I was unable to order a snack at this place, I did try one of the famous teas. The San Francisco Fog is a Jasmine Tea with milk and honey, adding a cozy touch to your study session for only $5.25, a reasonable price for a tea in the city. They did offer a selection of sandwiches and bagels that I would definitely try next time as I am most likely visiting again.

        Sacred Grounds also gets a thumbs up for its hours: open bright and early at 7 AM until 7 PM, catering to both morning birds and night owls alike. This is a special advantage as I found that most coffee shops in the area close around 3 to 5 PM. I spent my Wednesday morning here from aound 11:30 to 1:30 PM which made the environment quite peaceful and not too busy. Plus, it is one of the more convient locations as it is just a 8 minute walk from the University of San Francisco and a quick bus ride from Japantown. Finding a spot to settle in isn't a hassle either, with plenty of seating available and not much of a crowd. WiFi can be a bit sluggish when the cafe is crowded, which might be a bummer if you need a speedy connection. And while they do have a few power sockets, they're not always accessible. Still, when I scouted the area, 2-3 outlets were in sight.

        Overall, I give Sacred Grounds a solid 7 out of 10. It's got a great vibe, killer tea, and a location that's hard to beat. So, if you're in the mood for a productive study sesh with a side of old-school SF charm, Sacred Grounds is definitely worth checking out.
